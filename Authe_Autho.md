### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization Tools**

#### 1. **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Providers**

These are standards, but many tools and services implement them:

- **Auth0** – Full-featured authentication-as-a-service.
    
- **Okta** – Enterprise-grade identity and access management.
    
- **Firebase Authentication** – Easy-to-use backend service by Google.
    
- **AWS Cognito** – Authentication and user management by AWS.
    
- **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** – Enterprise authentication from Microsoft.
    
- **Keycloak** – Open-source identity and access management for modern apps.
    

#### 2. **Libraries for Implementing Authentication**

##### **Frontend**

- **jwt-decode** – Decodes JSON Web Tokens on the client-side.
    
- **@auth0/auth0-react / @auth0/nextjs-auth0** – Easy integration with Auth0 in React or Next.js apps.
    
- **Firebase SDK** – Provides auth methods and integrations (Google, Facebook, etc.).
    
- **next-auth** – Authentication for Next.js applications with support for providers like Google, GitHub, etc.
    

##### **Backend**

- **Passport.js (Node.js)** – Authentication middleware for Node, supports OAuth, local, JWT, etc.
    
- **jsonwebtoken (Node.js)** – Used to sign, verify JWTs.
    
- **bcrypt** – For password hashing (used during login/register).
    
- **Spring Security (Java)** – Authentication and authorization in Spring-based Java apps.
    
- **Devise (Ruby on Rails)** – Full-featured auth solution for Rails apps.
    

#### 3. **Authorization Libraries**

- **CASL (JavaScript)** – Declarative permissions management.
    
- **AccessControl (Node.js)** – Role and permission-based access control.
    
- **CanCanCan (Ruby)** – Role-based authorization for Rails.
    
- **Pundit (Ruby)** – Simple, policy-based authorization.
    

---

### 🔧 Other Useful Tools

- **JWT.io** – Debug and decode JWTs.
    
- **Postman / Insomnia** – Test authentication headers and token-based APIs.
    
- **OAuth Tools (like AuthDebugger)** – Simulate OAuth flows for testing.
  
  ---
There are **four main types of access control models** used to manage **authorization** in systems and applications:

---

### 🔑 **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Access is based on the **user's role** within an organization.  
**Example**: An "Admin" can delete users, while a "User" can only view their own data.

- **Simple to manage**
    
- Common in enterprise systems
    
- **Roles are predefined**, like Admin, Editor, Viewer
    

---

### 🔐 **2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

Access is granted based on **attributes (metadata)** about the user, resource, and environment.  
**Example**:  
Allow access if:

- User’s department = “Finance”
    
- Resource type = “Financial Report”
    
- Time of access = “9 AM to 5 PM”
    
- Highly flexible
    
- Can enforce complex policies
    
- Used in government and high-security applications
    

---

### 🧩 **3. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**

The **owner of a resource** decides who can access it.  
**Example**: A Google Drive file owner shares it with selected people.

- Flexible but can be **less secure**
    
- Users manage their own resources
    

---

### 🛡️ **4. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

A **central authority** controls access based on security labels.  
**Example**: Military documents labeled as Confidential, Secret, Top Secret.

- Very strict and **non-discretionary**
    
- Used in government/military settings
    
- Users **cannot change permissions**
    

---

### Bonus: 📊 **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**

An advanced version of ABAC, often used in cloud systems, where access is governed by **policies written in a language like Rego (OPA)**.


### 📊 Access Control Models Comparison Table

|**Model**|**Description**|**Example Use Case**|**Flexibility**|**Granularity**|**Scalability**|**Complexity**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**|Resource owners define access permissions.|File sharing among users.|Low|Low|Low|Low|
|**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**|Central authority enforces access based on classifications.|Military or government systems.|Very Low|Medium|Medium|High|
|**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**|Access rights assigned based on user roles.|Corporate environments with defined job roles.|Medium|Medium|High|Medium|
|**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**|Access decisions based on user attributes and environmental conditions.|Healthcare systems requiring context-aware access.|High|High|High|High|
|**Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**|Access governed by high-level organizational policies.|Enterprises enforcing compliance and governance.|High|High|High|High|
|**Rule-Based Access Control (RuBAC)**|Access determined by specific rules, such as time or location constraints.|Systems restricting access during certain hours.|Medium|Medium|High|Medium|

_Note: The flexibility, granularity, scalability, and complexity ratings are relative and may vary based on specific implementations._
